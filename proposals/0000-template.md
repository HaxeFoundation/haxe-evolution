## Motivation

Describe the problems adressed by this feature. If a similar effect

help developers write better Haxe code or how it will improve the generation
of target code by the compiler.

## Detailed design

Describe the proposed design in details the way language user can understand
and compiler developer can implement. Show corner cases, provide usage examples,
describe how this solution is better than current workarounds.

## Impact on existing code

What impact this change will have on existing code? Will it break compilation?
Will it compile, but break in run-time? How easy it is to migrate existing Haxe code?

## Drawbacks

Describe the drawbacks of the proposed design worth consideration. This doesn't include
breaking changes, since that's described in the previous section.
